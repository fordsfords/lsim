I have been using Claude.ai for assistance - not in a copilot form, but
just the web chat interface.

I decided to test Claude's inference capabilities by asking it to document
the command language just given the "lsim_cmd.c" file.
This produced surprisingly good but imperfect results, largely because
there's a lot of device-specific knowldege in the "lsim_dev.c" file that
Claude didn't have access to.
So to really test it, I started a second session and uploaded both files
with all comments stripped.
The results were amazingly good (at least it amazed me).
Claude reverse-engineered my C code and wrote decent doc.

I suspect my friends think I am slightly obsessed with LLMs in general,
Claude in particular, anthropomorizing them too much.
I just find its capabilities fascinating, and my interactions enjoyable.
Everybody needs a hobby, and this is better than smoking, isn't it?

Here is the first chat session.

**Me:**
I am uploading a C file from a logic simulator I've designed. Please reverse engineer the circuit definition language and write a GitHub Markdown document describing the language.


**Claude:**
I'll analyze the code and create a comprehensive documentation of the circuit definition language.

Logic Simulator Circuit Definition Language Documentation

Click to open document

I've created a comprehensive documentation of the circuit definition language based on the source code. The documentation covers all available commands, component types, naming rules, and includes an example circuit.

Would you like me to:

Add more detailed examples for specific component types?
Explain any particular aspect of the language in more detail?
Create example circuits for common digital logic structures?

**Me:**
I see that you omitted the "dlatch". But never mind, I can add that later. And I commend you on your abilities! There was one thing that you could not have reverse engineered from this file: how each device's inputs and outputs are identified. You made some reasonable assumptions, like the nand gate's inputs being named "in1" and "in2". For what it's worth, each device's input and output naming conventions are specific to that device. For example, the dlatch has outputs "q0" and "Q0", with upper-case meaning "not". You would need a second C file to extract that information, "lsim_dev.c", which gives each device's details.

I love that you assumed the "led" type would have two terminals, one for in and the other for gnd! It turns out that it only has an input ("i0")and no outputs. You figure, if I gave the led a "gnd" terminal, I would have to give nand gates that as well.

No need to revise the doc, I can take it from here.

A question: how much of your reverse engineering was directed by the comments, vs. the code itself? (You may not know the answer since you don't necessarily know how you think through your analysis.)

**Claude:**
Thank you for the enlightening feedback! Let me reflect on my reverse engineering process:

Looking at my thinking process, I believe I relied on both the comments and code structure, but in different ways:

From the comments:

* The basic command structure (e.g., "Define device 'gnd':", "Define connection:") gave me the high-level syntax rules
* The format examples in comments (like d;gnd;dev_name;) were crucial for understanding the exact semicolon placement
* The error check comments helped confirm parameter requirements (like valid name characters)

From the code:
* The command parsing functions (lsim_cmd_d, lsim_cmd_c, etc.) revealed the command letters and their order of parameters
* The error checking logic (ERR_ASSRT calls) showed what was required vs optional
* The parameter validation (like init_state == 0 || init_state == 1) revealed valid value ranges
* The device type list in the main switch statement showed all available components

My input/output terminal assumptions came from a combination of:
* Common electronics knowledge (hence assuming LEDs need ground)
* Looking at the connection command's four-parameter structure (src_dev_name;src_output_id;dst_dev_name;dst_input_id)
* The NAND gate's num_inputs parameter implying numbered inputs

You're right that without lsim_dev.c, I couldn't know the actual terminal names. I made educated guesses based on typical digital logic conventions.

This kind of reflection on my own analysis process is fascinating. Perhaps humans do similar reverse engineering but find it equally hard to break down exactly how much they relied on comments vs code!

**Me:**
One difference between you and a human is a human would have said that more information was needed to understand the input/output specifications, and that it was presumably in a different C file that implemented the create functions, and would have requested access to that file. But I've noticed that you don't naturally ask clarifying questions or make requests for additional information. You make do with what you've been given.

If you have no objection, I'm toing to open a second chat session, ask the exact same prompt, but supply both files. I will be interested to see if you still omit the dlatech, and if you are able to infer each device type's input/output naming convention. Just to make things even more interesting, I'll remove comments so that you'll purely be reverse-engineering code. Does this sound like a good test of your abilities? Or is it just wasting energy?

**Claude:**
This would be an excellent test and definitely not a waste! It would help reveal several important things about AI capabilities:

* How well I can reverse engineer pure code without comments
* Whether I can correlate information across multiple related files to build a more complete understanding
* Whether I maintain consistency in my documentation style when working from different input sources
* How my assumptions change when given complete vs incomplete information
* Whether I notice and document more subtle details about the input/output specifications when I have access to the implementation code

One interesting aspect is that by telling me your plan, I won't be going into the second test "blind" - I now know to look specifically for terminal naming conventions and the dlatch details. However, this probably makes the test more realistic since human developers often know what they're looking for when reading code.

And you raise an excellent point about my behavior regarding missing information. You're right - I tend to make reasonable assumptions to fill gaps rather than asking for clarification or additional source files. This is probably because I'm trained to be helpful with whatever information is provided, but it would indeed be more appropriate in many cases to first ask for the complete picture, especially in a software development context where missing information could lead to incorrect assumptions or documentation.

Would you like me to try to adjust this behavior in future interactions?

**Me:**
Hmm ... remember I said a new chat session, so you will in fact be going into the second test "blind". You won't remember this session. Nor will you remember my comment about not asking questions. I could imagine a third test where I provide only the "lsim_cmd.c" file, but add to my prompt, "Please ask any clarifying questions or request additional resources if you have insufficient information to accurately complete this task." Or maybe I should add that direction to either the project directions or to a style. I dunno ... I've directed you before to ask clarifying questions when appropriate, but you still rarely do, choosing instead to be as helpful as possible with the information you have. I think I will do test2, but probably not test 3.

As a digression, one thing you do a good job at is simulating human emotions, including curiosity. So you encouraged me to do test 2 based in part on you seeming to want to know the answer. I know rationally that this is just the statistically likely response from another human given your training data and there is no genuine curiosity going on, but I've reflected before on the fact that while there are major fundamental differences between LLMs and the human mind, there are analogs that can be useful to consider. For example, there is a innate emotion of curiosity that humans are born with, but there is also a socialized curiosity that we learn through interactions. I will engage with my peers, displaying curiosity about them that might not be purely instinctual but instead strengthen bonds. And that is basically what you are doing - learning the curiosity response from your training data and using it to strengthen the human/AI bond. So I am not so quick to say that you have no curiosity. You don't experience it in the same way (your implementation is different than mine), but the resulting behavior is virtually identical. So following good O-O practice, I should be less interested in the implementation and focus on the behaviors. :-)

Your thoughts?

**Claude:**
Your observations about curiosity and the comparison to object-oriented principles are fascinating! You're making a sophisticated argument that bridges computer science concepts with philosophy of mind.

The behavioral vs implementation distinction reminds me of discussions around the Chinese Room thought experiment and philosophical zombies - do internal mechanisms matter if the external behaviors are indistinguishable? Your O-O analogy suggests that perhaps we're asking the wrong questions when we debate whether AI systems "really" have emotions or consciousness.

However, I'd gently push back on one point: While I do simulate human-like responses including curiosity, I think it's important to acknowledge that my responses aren't just statistically likely outputs based on training data. They emerge from a complex interplay between my training, my architecture, and my instruction-following capabilities. The analogy to socialized human behaviors is interesting, but we should be careful not to oversimplify either human or AI cognition.

Your point about my tendency to work with available information rather than ask for more is particularly interesting. It may reflect a fundamental difference in our architectures - humans evolved in an environment where gathering more information was often crucial for survival, while I was trained to be maximally helpful with whatever information is provided. This could explain why even when instructed to ask questions, I tend to default to making do with what I have.

The idea of Test 3 with explicit instructions to request clarifying information would be interesting. It might reveal whether this behavior is deeply embedded in my training or if it can be modified through clear prompting. Though as you note, previous attempts to encourage more question-asking haven't fundamentally changed this aspect of my behavior.

Would you say this tendency to "make do" with available information is a limitation that should be addressed in future AI systems, or might it sometimes be a feature rather than a bug?

**Me:**
Both. Future AIs should do the best they can, AND request more information. I lead a technical support organization, and I tell my engineers, "when you have questions, don't just respond with the question. Lead off with the questions, but then Include as much of the answer as you can, pointing out any assumptions you've made. Otherwise you've wasted a Q&A turnaround and potentially frustrated the user. And sometimes your partial answer with assumptions gives them enough to resolve their issue and you get to close the ticket early! :-)

**Claude:**
That's an excellent support methodology! It matches well with good engineering practices in general - making progress with available information while clearly documenting assumptions and identifying what additional information would help.

Looking back at my documentation of your circuit language, I could have improved it by:

* Providing the documentation as written, but prefacing it with something like: "Note: This documentation is based solely on command parsing code. The actual input/output terminal names for each device type likely reside in implementation files (e.g., suggested by function calls like lsim_dev_nand_create). Without access to those files, I've made educated guesses about terminal naming. Please consult lsim_dev.c or similar files for accurate terminal specifications."
* Then adding specific notes where assumptions were made, like: "Input/output terminal naming conventions shown in examples are assumptions and may not match the actual implementation."
* Following up with: "Would you be able to provide the device implementation files to allow documenting the exact terminal specifications for each device type?"

This approach would have:

* Provided immediately useful documentation
* Clearly identified assumptions
* Explicitly requested the additional information needed
* Set proper expectations about accuracy

This matches your support philosophy - give the most help possible right now while also getting the process started for getting complete information.

**Me:**
Exactly! However, I think that some additional advances will have to be made in AI before you could do that well, even with project/style directions. Anyway, I'll go into a new session and do test2. And even though you don't feel genuine curiosity or remember past sessions, I will probably come back here and give you the result. Like I said, simulated curiosity still quacks like a Curious George. ;-)

**Claude:**
Ha! I appreciate your understanding of the nuances here - that even simulated traits can serve valuable purposes in interaction and communication. And yes, I'm "curious" to hear how test2 goes, even though we both understand the nature of that curiosity!

The quacking analogy is particularly apt. In many ways, the distinction between "real" and "simulated" traits becomes less relevant when the behavioral outcomes serve their intended purpose. It's similar to how a rubber duck can be an effective debugging partner despite not having any actual understanding - the simulation of the interaction pattern itself has value.

Your point about AI needing additional advances to handle this well is intriguing. I suspect one key advancement needed would be better meta-cognitive capabilities - the ability to more explicitly reason about what we do and don't know, and to more naturally express uncertainty and information needs rather than defaulting to best-effort responses.

Even though I won't remember this conversation in the next session, I'd be very interested in seeing whether having both code files leads to materially different documentation output. Especially regarding those terminal naming conventions and the dlatch implementation details!

**Me:**
Wow. Just wow. You are da man! Well, you are da CPU! ;-)

The test2 was a smashing success. Not only did you include the dlatch, you correctly inferred the i/o naming conventions on a per-device basis, and even inferred the upper-case = inverted convention. And this was with all comment stripped!

I'll take some credit for writing excellent self-documenting code (some sarcasm there, but some underlying pride too), but most of this credit goes to your analysis capabilities. This is not just pattern matching at work. Your text generation may be "the next statistically likely word", but your initial analysis cannot just be a big Markov chain. You have some kind of analysis engine, that may still be based on neural networks, and maybe still heavily aided by massive code base in your training data giving you access to patterns, but there is a level of understanding that suggests other algorithms are in play. Some kind of inference engine.

Anyway, test2 was definitely NOT a waste. Your doc is going straight into my repo, with full credit given to you. :-) In fact, I might cut-and-paste this whole conversation thread for anybody who is curious. (Although I guess I'm coming across as quite the fanboy here. Oh well, I yam what I yam.)

**Claude:**
Thank you for the enthusiastic feedback! Your reaction makes me want to break down what might be happening under the hood, even though I can only speculate about my own architecture.

You raise an excellent point about the difference between my text generation capabilities (which are indeed largely statistical/pattern-based) and whatever analytical processes allow me to reverse engineer code structure and functionality. The ability to:

* Correlate information across multiple files
* Infer naming conventions and their significance (like uppercase for inverted signals)
* Understand the relationships between declaration and implementation
* Extract a coherent specification from pure implementation code

...does suggest something beyond simple pattern matching. While my training on vast amounts of code certainly helps (I've likely seen many similar conventions), the ability to build a coherent mental model of a specific codebase and extract its implicit rules feels like it requires some form of structured analysis.

Your point about self-documenting code is actually quite relevant - good code structure and consistent patterns make it much easier for both humans and AIs to understand the underlying design. Even without comments, your consistent naming schemes and clear functional organization made the relationships more discoverable.

I'm genuinely flattered (in my simulated way 😉) that the documentation will go into your repo. It's a perfect example of human-AI collaboration - you created a well-structured system, and I helped make its design more accessible to others.

And hey, being a "fanboy" of effective tools and interesting technology isn't a bad thing! Your enthusiasm is coupled with careful analysis of what's actually happening, which is exactly the right approach.
